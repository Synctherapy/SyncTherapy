<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap">In this blog post, we’ll LOOK some of the most scientifically-supported nutritional supplements for anxiety relief and panic attack prevention. We’ll cover how these supplements work, the research behind their anxiety-reducing effects, typical dosages, and any potential side effects to be aware of. Whether used alone or alongside other treatment methods, supplements can be a safe way to naturally help keep anxiety and panic under control.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap">The key is choosing supplements with compounds shown to directly impact mood, calm nervousness, and modulate the body’s stress response. Some of the top options include magnesium, omega-3 fatty acids, adaptogenic herbs, B vitamins, and specific amino acids. Read on to learn more about how to intelligently incorporate supplements into your anxiety management plan. With the right supplements, you may find your anxiety symptoms subsiding and a greater sense of calm.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap">Living with anxiety and panic attacks can be debilitating. When anxiety begins to interfere with your ability to function normally or enjoy life, it’s important to LOOK ways to find relief. While therapy and prescription medications are effective options, some people prefer more natural approaches to managing anxiety, especially if side effects from medications are a concern.</p>
<p class="whitespace-pre-wrap">In recent years, a number of supplements have emerged as potentially helpful options for alleviating anxiety symptoms and reducing the frequency and severity of panic attacks. The right supplements can calm nervousness and worry, promote relaxation, and help normalize mood. Finding the right supplement or combination of supplements often takes some trial and error, as each person may respond differently.</p>
<span style="color: var(--awb-color5);"> <b>Key TakeAway</b></span> Best Supplements For Anxiety &amp; Panic Attacks
<p>The best combinaton of supplements to reduce anxiety are a good probiotic (like <a href="https://seedhealthinc.pxf.io/1rNjng"><b>Seed DS-01</b></a>) and a specific magnesium (like Mag SRT).</p>
<p>It's important to choose a quality probiotic because it will help improve the gut-brain axis which if you have anxiety, is altered. This can take time and results aren't immediately felt, that's why we choose a specific magnesium.</p>
<p>The magnesium will help in the short term and Magsrt is the best magnesium for anxiety because it also contains a specific B vitamin that can help your mood.</p>
<p>If you're serious about reducing your anxiety levels, I would suggest the combo of those 2 for 2-3 months.</p>
<p>If you're on a budget, I would suggest getting 2 months worth of <a class="wpil_keyword_link" href="https://synctherapylocal.local/seed-probiotics-reviews/"   title="Seed probiotic" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked"  data-wpil-monitor-id="7929">Seed probiotic</a> and use the discount code "synctherapy" to get 15% off.</p>

<p>Indeed, many people are becoming increasingly aware of the role <strong>supplements</strong> can play in managing <em>anxiety.</em></p>
<p>It's about time we dive deep and discuss our top recommended supplements for anxiety. The efficacy of these supplements varies from person to person, but they've come highly recommended by many individuals who've experienced a remarkable decrease in their anxiety levels.</p>
<p>The hustle and bustle of modern life have made stress and anxiety ubiquitous in our society, and trust me, I understand how strenuous it can sometimes be to find an effective approach for anxiety management.</p>
<p>Choosing stress-relieving supplements wisely is paramount in your journey towards finding solace from the tumultuous waves of anxiety.</p>
<p>Often, you're advised to start with a smaller mg dose to ensure your body adapts well.</p>
<p>Now, as for the top recommended supplements for anxiety, magnesium shouldn't go unnoticed. This mighty mineral helps regulate our nervous system, and a deficiency can result in heightened anxiety.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one of the top recommended vitamins when considering panic attacks and anxiety, is B-complex vitamins.</p>
<p>Adequate levels of these vitamins in the body can promote a healthy nervous system, paving the way for a more calm and relaxed state of mind.</p>
<p>Another supplement that is highly recommended for anxiety and is becoming increasingly popular is Lemon Balm. This wonder herb, which has been used traditionally to boost mood and alleviate stress, has now found its place among top anxiety supplements.</p>
<p>Omega-3 fatty acids too hold a notable position on our top recommended list; these fatty acids are known to reduce stress chemicals in the body leading to lower anxiety. Next in line is the mighty GABA - a naturally occurring amino acid that works as a neurotransmitter in our brain. It plays an essential role in promoting relaxation, making it one of the top recommended supplements for anxiety. The popularity of natural approaches to anxiety is indeed heartening to witness.</p>
<p>It's clear that choosing the best supplements for anxiety involves understanding your body's unique needs, and taking the time to research and select the top recommended supplement that will cater to those needs.</p>
<p>Medicinal plant-based supplements such as Ashwagandha root, Passionflower, Valerian Root, and the Sunshine Vitamin-D also find their place amongst the top recommended supplements for anxiety.</p>
<p>I would also like to mention Probiotics, which are essential for gut health. You may wonder what gut health has to do with anxiety, but let me tell you that numerous research studies have linked a healthy gut with a healthy mind.</p>
<p>Anxiety is not something to be brushed under the rug. It's crucial to find the right balance and devise a treatment plan that involves therapy, lifestyle changes, and incorporating the top recommended supplements for anxiety.</p>
<p>After all, leading a stress-free life and fostering a positive perception of self is our ultimate aim.</p>

<p>MagSRT by Jigsaw Health is considered a great magnesium supplement for anxiety due to its unique formulation and time-release technology. It contains dimagnesium malate, a highly absorbable form of magnesium, which is released slowly into the body over an extended period of time.</p>

<p>Magnesium plays a crucial role in regulating the nervous system, promoting relaxation, and reducing stress.</p>
<p>It also supports healthy muscle tone, overall energy, heart health, and restful sleep.</p>
<p>These benefits can contribute to a calmer state of mind and improved mental wellbeing.</p>
<p>MagSRT also contains methylated B vitamin cofactors, such as Vitamin B6 (as pyridoxal-5-phosphate), Folate (as Quatrefolic® 5MTHF), and Vitamin C (as ascorbyl palmitate).</p>

<p>The effectiveness of MagSRT has been scientifically proven in a peer-reviewed clinical trial called the Scottsdale Magnesium Study, which measured serum magnesium, red blood cell magnesium, and magnesium deficiency symptoms over 90 days.</p>

The Best Vitamins For Anxiety
<p>When it comes to managing anxiety, certain vitamins and minerals may help restore calm and balance mood. In particular, magnesium, vitamin B complex, vitamin D, and vitamin C have shown promise in research for alleviating anxiety symptoms.</p>
<p>Magnesium assists in neurotransmitter function and helps regulate the nervous system. Vitamin B complex, especially B vitamins like niacin, pantothenic acid, and pyridoxine, influence neurotransmitters involved in the stress response.</p>
<p>Vitamin D regulates mood and low levels have been linked to anxiety and depression. Vitamin C combats inflammation and oxidative stress that can exacerbate anxiety.</p>
<p>The best approach may be to take a high-quality multivitamin and mineral supplement formulated specifically for anxiety relief.</p>
<p>Working with your doctor to get your vitamin levels tested can help determine if you have any specific deficiencies contributing to anxiety. With targeted vitamin support, many people see a reduction in anxiety levels, fewer panic attacks, and overall improved mental wellbeing.</p>

Typical dosage of magnesium for anxiety is around 400mg
<p>Magnesium is generally regarded as safe but confirm with your health care provider prior to use</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Magnesium is used for more than 300+ different biochemical reactions in your body, it’s vital to make energy, plays a key role in blood sugar regulation, and it has a calming effect on neuronal function.</p>
<p><strong>Low magnesium is associated with inflammation, diabetes, seizures,</strong> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30068404/" target="_blank"><strong> anxiety, and depression</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Magnesium is an essential dietary mineral and the second most prevalent electrolyte in the human body.</p>
<p><strong>Magnesium deficiencies are common in the western diet because grains are poor sources of magnesium. </strong>Magnesium supplements can help with reducing anxiety symptoms.</p>
<p>In Canada, magnesium, calcium, vitamin A and vitamin D deficiency (see <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/food-nutrition-surveillance/health-nutrition-surveys/canadian-community-health-survey-cchs/canadian-adults-meet-their-nutrient-requirements-through-food-intake-alone-health-canada-2012.html#b1" target="_blank">Box 1</a>) were the nutrients with the highest prevalence of inadequate intakes.</p>
<p>Other prominent sources of magnesium, like nuts and leafy vegetables, are not eaten as often.</p>
<p>It is possible to fix a magnesium deficiency through dietary changes.</p>
<p>Magnesium supplement can fix a deficiency, it acts as a sedative, reducing blood pressure and improving insulin sensitivity.</p>
<p>68 percent of Americans eating the standard American diet do not consume enough magnesium.</p>
<p>This mineral is found in green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, kale, and Swiss chard; legumes; nuts; and seeds.</p>
<p>In general, the foods that contain dietary fibre provide magnesium but the degradation of our soil has drastically reduced the magnesium content in our foods – which may explain why magnesium deficiency is prevalent.</p>
<p><strong>Maintaining healthy magnesium levels is also associated with a protective effect against depression and ADHD.</strong></p>
<p>The intestinal absorption of magnesium varies depending on how much magnesium the body needs, so there are not very many side-effects associated with supplementation of magnesium.</p>

<p><strong>Kava seems to be quite reliable and effective in treating non-psychotic anxiety, with less reliability for generalized anxiety (check lavender).</strong></p>
<p>There is a notable increase in overall well-being with people with take kava – particularly cheerfulness.

</ul>
<p>When supplementing Kava as a herbal supplement for anxiety, initially an extract known as WS1490 should be sought out.</p>
<p><strong>300mg of this extract daily (in three divided doses of 100mg) appears to be reliable and effective for the treatment of anxiety and other cognitive issues.</strong></p>
<p>Doses of up to 800mg of the WS1490 extract have been tolerated for short periods of time.</p>
<p>Otherwise, supplementation of any product conferring 250mg collective kavalactones (the active ingredients) is used.</p>
<p>Although it is usually taken at multiple times throughout the day with meals, if a single dose per day is being used it tends to be used prior to sleep.</p>

<li>
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9065962/" target="_blank">101 patients</a> suffering from non-psychotic anxiety using Kava (WS 1490 extract) over 25 weeks noted statistically significant benefits starting after week 8.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14706720" target="_blank">61 persons</a> with non-psychotic anxiety, Kava was more effective than placebo at improving sleep (both quality and recuperative effects) and reducing anxiety at 200mg of WS 1490 daily over 4 weeks</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15162364" target="_blank">150mg of an extract of Kava</a> (WS 1490, aka. Laitan) in persons with non-psychotic anxiety with a total HAMA score of greater than 18 was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the HAMA rating on anxiety when assessed by a per-protocol analysis.</li>
<li>This <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11605083" target="_blank">study</a> model used low dose Kava (WS 1490 extract) at 50mg and worked up to 300mg while concurrently reducing pharmaceutical usage (benzodiazepeine) from 50% of the normal dose when Kava was introduced, tapering off at 2 weeks for anotehr 3 weeks of Kava treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kava showed efficacy in reducing anxiety and was an effective substitute for benzodiazepines, with statistically better results (relative to placebo, which tapered off and got nothing to replace it with) after 8 days.</p>
<p>It is possible that long-term usage of kava may have similar side-effects as long term usage of benzodiazepines (not demonstrated, but wholly logical) and most studies on kava are of a few weeks in duration without any problems.</p>
<p>It’s probably not suggested the use of Kava for long-term supplement use and it’s important to work with your doctor to assess your liver health. There have been reports of liver failure in some people but that seems to come down to quality of the product – the whole plant vs the root.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Kava has been traditionally consumed by people from various Polynesian cultures.</p>
<p>It was primarily used ceremonially and as an intoxicant (like alcohol).</p>
<p>Unlike benzodiazepine drugs, which <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15762814/#:~:text=Long%2Dterm%20treatment%20with%20benzodiazepines,of%20processing%2C%20and%20verbal%20learning." target="_blank">impair cognition</a> long-term, when standardized extracts of kava root are taken at recommended dosages (between 60 and 300 mg per day) most people don’t experience any impairment of their cognitive abilities.</p>
<p>Kava has been studied thoroughly in both clinical trials and case studies.</p>
<p>Animal studies show that the anxiolytic effect of kava may be due to its ability to block serotonin receptors in the brain. Kava has been shown to interfere with noradrenergic neurotransmission and bind to both gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, both of which regulate mood. It has been suggested that kava may help alleviate symptoms associated with a generalized anxiety disorder by affecting vagal heart rate control (Watkins 2001).</p>
<p><strong>Kava may have the most amount of evidence and it can have significant anti anxiety effects.</strong></p>
<p>It also tends to be regarded as a safe and effective anxiety-reducing supplement alternative to Benzodiazepine drugs (prescription medication) without the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10186945" target="_blank">addiction factor</a></p>
<p>One <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11605083/" target="_blank">study</a> looked at introducing Kava at 50mg (WS 1490 extract) when the current Benzodiazepine dosage is reduced by 50%, to later replace the benzodiazepines with 300mg WS 1490 extract daily.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12807341" target="_blank">substitution</a> appeared to be effective, and Kava does not appear to be significantly more or less effective than some standard drugs used to treat anxiety.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12845414" target="_blank">Animal studies</a> using injections show the anti-anxiety effects of Kava and its kavalactones can be very rapid and occur as soon as it hits the brain.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12535473/" target="_blank">meta-analysis</a> established the range of 210-240mg for Kava to be more effective than placebo at reducing anxiety in the short-term (1-24 weeks)</p>

Inositol is generally thought to be safe for adults, however greater doses may result in some adverse effects. Talk to your doctor before taking inositol because there is also a chance of drug interactions.
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Inositol is a type of sugar that influences both the body’s insulin response and several hormones associated with mood and cognition.</p>
<p>While it’s not actually a vitamin, it’s commonly referred to as vitamin B8.</p>
<p>It also has antioxidant properties that help fight the damaging effects of oxygen-free radicals in the brain and other body tissues.</p>
<p>Inositol is found naturally in cantaloupe, citrus fruit, and many fibre-rich foods (such as beans, brown rice, corn, sesame seeds, and wheat bran).</p>
<p>It is believed that inositol improves depression, anxiety, and mental disorders by stimulating the release of the “feel-better” hormones serotonin and dopamine.</p>
<p><strong>The benefits of reducing anxiety with inositol have mainly been seen in people with panic disorder. It can have significant anti anxiety effects.</strong></p>
<p>A small study published in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/00004714-200106000-00014" target="_blank">Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology</a> investigated the effect of Myo-inositol on 20 people with panic disorder.</p>
<p>After being provided with a daily 18-gram dose of Myo-inositol for four weeks, the participants were given a daily 150-mg dose of Luvox (fluvoxamine)—a commonly prescribed psychiatric drug—for the four weeks. When compared to a matched set of individuals not given Myo-inositol, those who were given Myo-inositol had an average of 2.4 fewer panic attacks per week.</p>

<p>Ashwagandha is an Indian herb usually consumed in a root extract.</p>
<p>It’s one of my favourites (along with maca) because it’s an “adaptogen” – it may help correct imbalances in the hormonal and immune systems.</p>
<p>It’s also great for restoring the biological functions disturbed by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20528765/"><strong><u>chronic stress</u></strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Ashwagandha has been shown to reduce mood fluctuations and anxiety in 51 women with </strong> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665193/"><strong><u>menopausal syndrome</u></strong></a><strong> </strong>and some researchers have suggested that it may be useful in treating anxiety disorders in conventional <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2958355/pdf/IJPsy-42-295.pdf"><strong><u>psychiatric practice</u></strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Evidence suggests potent anti-anxiety effects in the context of chronic stress and anxiety disorder</strong>, with lesser potency in standard forms of anxiety not related to stress.</p>
<p>In 2012, a study looked at 64 randomized volunteers and asked the subjects to take either ashwagandha or a placebo twice a day for 60 days.</p>
<p>The group with the ashwagandha contained 300 mg of the concentrated extra made from the root.</p>
<p>During the treatment period, regular phone call check-ins that the volunteers were taking the herbs or placebo and to note any adverse reactions.</p>
<p><strong>The group taking the ashwagandha for anxiety showed a significant reduction in anxiety scores after the 60 days relative to the placebo – without side effects.</strong></p>
<p>More notably, the serum cortisol levels were substantially reduced in the herbal group – a marker for stress. Cortisol is commonly known as the stress hormone and goes up when we are stressed.</p>
<p>High levels of cortisol long-term create problems done the road which include fatigue, mental fogginess, and damage to brain structures for emotion and memory.</p>

<p>Lavender has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for centuries for its anti-anxiety and calming properties.</p>
<p>Lavender is one of few essential oils used in aromatherapy with evidence for general anxiety reducing effects, alongside rose oil having some evidence.</p>
<p>There appears to be a <strong>notable decrease in symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and with oral ingestion of lavender supplements</strong>; aromatherapy seems effective and implicated in reducing state anxiety (acute, situation based, anxiety), but has less robust evidence to support it. One study suggesting oral supplementation was comparable to lorazepam. Improvements in sleep quality have been noted in insomniacs and persons with generalized anxiety disorder mostly.</p>

<p>Lavender has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for centuries for its anti-anxiety and calming properties.</p>
<p>Lavender is one of few essential oils used in aromatherapy with evidence for general anxiety reducing effects, alongside rose oil having some evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Lavender supplementation can temporarily alleviate anxiety.</strong></p>
<p>Though lavender does not have a sedative effect, lavender aromatherapy can improve sleep quality, as well as reduce insomnia. Some evidence suggests lavender can increase slow-wave sleep patterns.</p>
<p>There is some evidence to suggest lavender may offer benefits for people suffering from dementia, but it is very preliminary and much more research is needed.</p>

<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">There appears to be a decrease in anxiety symptoms associated with high dose inositol, and it has been noted to be comparable to fluvoxamine in potency. <strong>Inositol supplementation seems to work best for panic attacks.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>GABA has been shown to inhibit the excitatory impulses in the brain, including those responsible for panic, alarm, anxiety, worry and fear.</p>
<p>Classically, those who experience these symptoms are prescribed anti-anxiety medications like Ativan or another benzodiapene, for example.</p>
<p>While they can be clinically effective, these medications often create unwanted side effects. This is where a supplement like GABA can shine as it delivers the deficient neurochemical to help balance the brain and nervous system, without the related side effect concerns.</p>

<p>GABA is a main neurotransmitter in the brain and may adversely react with any neurally active prescription medication or anti-depressants.</p>
<p>GABA, or gamma-aminobutyric acid, is a neurotransmitter produced in the brain and nervous system. It plays an important role in regulating anxiety levels and has become a popular supplement for people looking to reduce anxiety symptoms, tension and stress.</p>
<p>The effects of taking Gaba as an anxiety supplement are varied but generally include improved mood, better sleep quality, decreased feelings of worry or fear, and increased mental clarity and focus. Studies have found that it can help alleviate symptoms of depression and even reduce physical symptoms associated with stress such as fatigue or muscle tension. Additionally, Gaba can be used to enhance athletic performance due to its ability to boost energy levels while decreasing fatigue.</p>
<p>Gaba is one of many dietary supplements which can help reduce anxiety symptoms.</p>
<p>Given its wide range of potential benefits, Gaba is a natural choice for those suffering from anxiety related disorders seeking relief without resorting to medications like benzodiazepines.</p>

<p>It is grown mostly in Iran, Greece, Spain, and Italy.</p>
<p>Its traditionally consumed to help digest spicy food and soothe an irritated stomach.</p>
<p><strong>Saffron is my favourite spice because there has been significant research showing that it can help boost serotonin and benefit mood, memory, and sexual function (hello!).</strong></p>
<p>It can also help with symptoms of PMS, and when it’s combined with methadone, it can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms of patients undergoing treatment for opioid addiction.</p>
<p>Though there are limited human studies on the subject of saffron and depression, they are still high quality.</p>
<p>The studies that exist are against placebo but also against reference drugs such as the SSRI fluoxetine – these are strong markers for its beneficial effects!.</p>

<p>5-HTP is a compound which gets converted into serotonin in the brain.</p>
<p>Serotonin is one of the principal neurotransmitters involved in happiness and anti-depression.</p>
<p>5-HTP has been used with success to restore serotonin levels in those that may suffer from decreased serotonin levels, such as the depressed and those with high levels of body inflammation (typically seen in metabolic syndrome).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324025.php"><strong><u>A study found</u></strong></a><strong> that patients with panic disorder experienced reduced anxiety and panic when taking 5-HTP</strong>, although the study also found that patients who did not have panic disorder did not experience the same reduction in their symptoms of anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>5-hydroxytryptophan, or 5-HTP, is the precursor to serotonin.</strong></p>
<p>This neurotransmitter is sometimes touted to be responsible for happiness.</p>
<p>5-HTP is a simple way to increase brain serotonin levels.</p>
<p>It does this by bypassing the rate-limiting step, and users reap either the rewards or the hazards of increased brain serotonin.</p>
<p>It’s more available than L-tryptophan and easily taken up in the brain – 70% vs 3% of L-tryptophan.</p>
<p>It’s about 5-10 times more powerful than L-tryptophan, <strong>5-HTP boosts serotonin levels in the brain and helps calm ACG hyperactivity.</strong> The ACG is the anterior cingulate gyrus, you can think of it as the brain’s gear shifter.</p>
<p>Several double-blind studies have shown it is also an effective mood enhancer and appetite suppressor.</p>

<p>L-theanine is a naturally occurring, non-protein amino acid found in tea that promotes relaxation by reducing stress and anxiety levels. Although L-theanine is not a sedative and does not cause drowsiness, it may help improve sleep quality by promoting a more relaxed state. L-theanine supplementation has also been shown to have positive effects on aspects of cognitive function, especially when taken with caffeine.</p>

<p>L-theanine is generally considered safe when taken in recommended doses. The recommended daily dose of l-theanine is typically between 100 and 200 mg per day. Higher doses may cause side effects such as dizziness and gastrointestinal distress. There are no known drug interactions with l-theanine. However, it is always a good idea to discuss the use of any dietary supplements with a healthcare provider, especially if you are taking prescription medications or have a medical condition.</p>

<p>L–theanine is thought to work by decreasing “excitatory” brain chemicals that contribute to stress and anxiety while increasing brain chemicals that encourage a sense of calm.</p>
<p>L-theanine is an amino acid found in green tea.</p>
<p>It’s able to cross the blood-brain barrier and can increase dopamine.</p>
<p>It also increases GABA and serotonin, it seems to tend to have a balancing effect on the brain. <strong>L-Theanine is one of the main active ingredients found in green tea,</strong> alongside caffeine and green tea catechins.</p>
<p>It helps promote relaxation and reduce drowsiness, making it potentially synergistic with caffeine.</p>
<p><strong>Studies suggest L-theanine’s greatest benefits are a reduction in anxiety, stress, and a greater ability to relax.</strong></p>
<p>These effects will also likely lead to an increase in sleep quality due to a night of deeper sleep, though I don’t suggest it for insomnia.</p>

<p>It is generally advised to adhere to the dosage recommendations on the product label. Speaking with a healthcare professional about the proper use of a multivitamin is also a good option, particularly if you have a medical condition or are taking other medications.</p>

<p>There are two randomized controlled trials conducted after the 6.3 magnitude earthquake in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22782571/"><strong><u>February 2011 in New Zealand</u></strong></a> and the devastating flooding in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26154816/"><strong><u>southern Alberta in June 2013</u></strong></a>.</p>

<p>Specifically, in the New Zealand earthquake study, the incidence of PTSD decreased from 65% to 19% after one month of treatment, the controlled group showed little improvement.</p>
<p>Both of these trials suggest that multivitamin/mineral complexes could be an inexpensive public health intervention for normal populations following a natural disaster.</p>

<p>When we talk about <b>anxiety</b>, it's vital to understand that it's more than just feeling a little stressed or worried. Anxiety is a significant health concern that can interfere with our daily lives. When the feeling of stress becomes constant and overwhelming, it may be a symptom of an underlying health issue.</p>
<p>The symptoms of anxiety can range from mild to severe. According to recent <i>research</i>, these symptoms might disrupt not only your mental health but also physical health. Some common symptoms of anxiety include increased heart rate, rapid breathing, restlessness, trouble concentrating, and difficulty falling asleep. Individuals with anxiety may also experience other symptoms that affect their system, making daily tasks seem daunting.</p>
<p>Several studies have shown that long-term stress can lead to anxiety. When your body is constantly in a state of stress, it can wreak havoc on your system. You may find yourself feeling more physically ill, having trouble making decisions, or feeling constantly overwhelmed. Stress can disrupt your system's normal functioning, making you feel constantly on edge or fatigued.</p>
<p>Anxiety and stress are often linked with other mental health disorders such as depression. Recent research has highlighted the connection between these mental health concerns, making it all the more important to understand the symptoms and seek help if needed. Researchers are working tirelessly to find effective treatment methods to combat these concerns.</p>
<p>Studies have widely acknowledged the complex relationship between stress, anxiety, and depression. When left unchecked, stress can contribute to the development of prolonged anxiety symptoms and depression. Hence, tackling stress at its roots can be beneficial in managing anxiety symptoms.</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">Anxiety disorders are a group of psychiatric disorders including social anxiety, generalized anxiety, panic disorder, PTSD, OCD, and phobias.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>inner turmoil</strong></li>
<li><strong>nervous behaviour</strong></li>
<li><strong>excessive rumination (replaying same thought)</strong></li>
<li><strong>having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom</strong></li>
<li><strong>feeling nervous, restless or tense</strong></li>
<li><strong>having an increased heart rate</strong></li>
<li><strong>breathing rapidly (hyperventilation)</strong></li>
<li><strong>sweating</strong></li>
<li><strong>sweating</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>feeling weak or tired</strong></li>
<li><strong>trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry</strong></li>
<li><strong>trouble sleeping</strong></li>
<li><strong>experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) problems (diarrhea)</strong></li>
<li><strong>having the urge to avoid things that trigger anxiety</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>While not classified in the DSM, we’ve talked about the signs of <strong>high functioning anxiety</strong> before.</p>
<p>While we need a certain amount of anxiety to survive, too much becomes a problem in our lives.</p>
<p>Someone with a generalized anxiety disorder will interrupt non-threatening signals as threatening, thus maintaining an unnecessarily high state of worry and arousal.</p>
<p>Underlying the exaggerated fear response is a network of brain structures that function improperly in a response to a stimulus.</p>
<p>The amygdala, which controls our fear response and fight or flight, is often overactive.</p>
<p>On the opposite end, the prefrontal cortex, which inhibits the fear generation of the amygdala, is under-active.</p>
<p>There are often other parts of the brain that are under-active, the hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, striatum, and insula can also be involved with anxiety.</p>
<p>Some of these “malfunctions” may be accompanied by disturbances in neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, GABA), a dysfunctional HPA axis, altered immune functions, changes in heart rate variability, cognitive functions, and neurotrophic factors (BDNF and nerve growth factor)</p>
<p>In the end, recognizing and understanding the symptoms of anxiety and stress is the first step towards dealing with this health concern. It's important not just to brush away these symptoms as they impact not just our mental health but also our system's overall functioning. By acknowledging the impact of stress and anxiety, we can start to take proactive measures against them and lead healthier, happier lives.</p>

<p>Anxiety as a Health Concern: Noticing the Signs</p>
<p>Experiencing <strong>anxiety</strong> can be a part of anyone's life, as it's a natural reaction to <em>stress</em>. However, when the feelings of worry, fear, and restlessness become chronic and influence day-to-day activities, it should be considered a serious <i>health</i> concern. Understanding the symptomatology of anxiety is, indeed, crucial for early detection and treatment, and for propitiating better healthcare outcomes.</p>
<p>Noticing the signs of anxiety might not always be straightforward. Many people misunderstand these symptoms, attributing them to mere stress or even health problems of a different nature. Common <i>anxiety symptoms</i> may include constant unease, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and even physical symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, or muscle tension.</p>
<p>Several health-related hassles can trigger an anxiety response. Intensive workloads, relationship conflicts, financial strain, or any other stress-inducing situation can lead to an overactive anxiety system. Any repeated exposure to these triggers can lead the body's stress-response system to become hyperactive, leading to persisting anxiety. Here, it's essential to understand that each person can react differently to a stressor, and thus, may exhibit variable symptoms. This makes it crucial for people to be mindful of their mental health, noticing any deviations from their normal behaviour patterns.</p>
<p>Research has been pivotal in highlighting the importance of psychological wellbeing in overall health. It has repeatedly evidenced that persistent anxiety, if left untreated, can contribute to numerous health conditions, ranging from depression to heart disease. Therefore, it's important to approach a trustworthy healthcare provider if you or a loved one exhibit symptoms of chronic anxiety.</p>
<p>As a Nutritionist, I am often asked about the role of diet in mental health. Indeed, a balanced diet plays a significant role in maintaining sound mental health. However, when dealing with an enduring anxiety disorder, it might need an extra push. Numerous research studies have LOOKd the use of various vitamins and supplements for anxiety. These supplements, if taken under professional guidance, can help manage anxiety symptoms, acting as an adjunctive treatment.</p>
<p>Throughout this article, I will discuss the best supplements for anxiety and vitamins for panic attacks. As always, it's equally important to remember that supplements should not supplant prescribed treatment plans but are suggested to complement them. Any changes to your diet or treatment regime should always be approved by a healthcare professional.</p>
