<blockquote>
<strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Trochanteric bursitis is a common condition in patients living with fibromyalgia. Trochanteric bursitis develops when two particular bursae in the hip become inflamed. One bursa is located on the greater trochanter and the other, called the iliopsoas bursa, is found on the inside of the hip in the groin. However, there is a particular cause for this. In my opinion, it's caused mostly caused by microbiome dysfunction, particularly SIBO. I have 2 suggestions, using a myofascial release and a supplement/diet approach. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy89qsM2Rc&amp;pp=ygULdGZsIHJlbGVhc2U%3D">You will use a tennis ball on your TFL and lay on to it for a few minutes.</a> This will be tender and uncomfortable, so I suggest laying on your bed to start. The other is a supplement. <strong>If it's right hip</strong>, <a href="https://justthrivehealth.com/?rfsn=7226569.9f42d5c">I would suggest this probiotic</a> because it's probably tension along your large intestine caused by SIBO, <strong>If it's your left hip</strong>, you'll probably want to <a href="https://amzn.to/3nQZDgp">increase your fibre intake with a psyllium husk</a> (think Metamucil)</blockquote>

Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder characterized by widespread pain in the body, fatigue, and tenderness in localized areas. While the exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, research suggests that it may be due to an abnormal response to pain signals in the brain. Other factors such as genetics, infections, or physical or emotional stress may also play a role in the development of the condition.<br>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Symptoms &amp; Causes:</h3>
<br>The symptoms of fibromyalgia can vary from person to person, but the most common symptoms include chronic widespread pain, fatigue, cognitive issues, and sleep disturbances. The pain associated with fibromyalgia is often described as a deep, aching, or burning sensation that affects different parts of the body, including the hips.<br>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Diagnosis:</h3>
<br>Diagnosing fibromyalgia can be challenging as there are no specific lab tests or imaging tests that can confirm the condition. Doctors often rely on a combination of patient-reported symptoms and a physical examination to make a diagnosis.<br>

<h2>Hip Pain &amp; Fibromyalgia:</h2>
Hip pain is a common complaint of people with fibromyalgia. The pain may be due to tender points in the hip area, inflammation in the joints, or muscle strain. It can be particularly debilitating, making it difficult to walk, sit, or stand for prolonged periods.<br>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Common Causes of Hip Pain:</h3>
In addition to fibromyalgia-related inflammation, other common causes of hip pain can include osteoarthritis, bursitis, tendinitis, or a hip fracture.<br>
<h2></h2>
<h2>How to Relieve Hip Pain:</h2>
Fortunately, there are several ways to relieve hip pain caused by fibromyalgia, including painkillers, physical therapy, and surgery. Painkillers such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help manage the pain. Physical therapy can also help alleviate pain, improve range of motion, and strengthen the affected muscles, while surgery may be necessary in severe cases of hip pain.<br>

<a href="https://synctherapylocal.local/conquering-hip-pain-a-fibromyalgia-warriors-guide/"  data-wpil-monitor-id="7903">Hip pain</a> is a common symptom experienced by people with fibromyalgia, and it can significantly affect their quality of life. There are many possible causes of hip pain in individuals with fibromyalgia, some of which include:
<ol>
<li>Muscle Tension: People with fibromyalgia often experience muscle tension and stiffness, which can lead to pain and discomfort in the hip area. This tension may result from the stress of living with fibromyalgia, or it may be a side effect of certain medications.</li>
<li>Joint Pain: Fibromyalgia can cause joint pain and inflammation, leading to hip pain. This is because fibromyalgia can affect the soft tissues surrounding the joints, causing them to become inflamed and painful.</li>
<li>Sciatica: Fibromyalgia can sometimes cause sciatica, a condition that occurs when the sciatic nerve is compressed or irritated. This can lead to pain in the hip, lower back, and legs.</li>
<li>Bursitis: Bursitis is a condition that occurs when the bursae (small fluid-filled sacs) found in the joints become inflamed. This can cause pain and discomfort in the hip area, and is a common problem in people with fibromyalgia.</li>
</ol>
If you are experiencing hip pain due to fibromyalgia, there are several strategies you can try to relieve your discomfort. Here are some proven methods:
<ul>
<li>Heat and Cold Therapy: Applying heat or cold to the affected area can help reduce pain and inflammation. You can use a heating pad, a cold compress, or alternate between the two.</li>
<li>Exercise and Stretching: Low-impact exercises, such as swimming or walking, can help reduce hip pain and stiffness. Stretching can also help increase flexibility and range of motion.</li>
<li>Acupuncture: Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine practice that involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body. This can help reduce pain and inflammation.</li>
<li>Massage and Relaxation: Massage therapy and relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing and meditation, can help reduce stress and alleviate hip pain.</li>
