<strong>Key TakeAway</strong> Gut Health Recipes</h2>

These foods can help balance your gut microbiome and improve digestion. Prebiotics, on the other hand, act as food for these good bacteria. Fiber-rich foods like garlic, onions, leeks, asparagus, and bananas are excellent sources of prebiotics.<br><br>Fermented foods not only contain probiotics but also offer unique flavors and potential health benefits.

<div class="bggle--block bggle_text margin_vertical--small margin-top_none" section-id="1732933487451">
<p>Adding probiotics, specifically spore based probiotics, you can help improve your gut health.<br><br>It's important to choose a full spore based probiotic supplement over other strains of probiotics.<br><br>The other strains, like the lactobacillus or bifido, aren't heat stable or will be killed in the stomach acid.<br><br>Choosing from the top rated spore based probiotics makes this easy to choose from. One of the top spore based probiotics on the market is called "Just Thrive" and you can sprinkle them in to your recipe to get the benefits of probiotics.</p>

<div class="bggle--block bggle_text margin_vertical--small margin-top_none" section-id="1732933487453">
<p>Incorporating prebiotics into your recipes is crucial for maintaining a healthy gut microbiome and overall well-being.<br><br>Prebiotics act as food for the beneficial bacteria in your digestive system, promoting their growth and activity.<br><br>By regularly consuming prebiotic-rich foods, you support digestive health, improve nutrient absorption, boost your immune system, and potentially reduce inflammation in the body.<br><br>Prebiotics have been linked to various health benefits, including better bowel function, improved calcium absorption, blood sugar regulation, and even potential mood regulation.<br><br>Unlike probiotic supplements, which introduce new bacteria, prebiotics nourish the existing beneficial microorganisms in your gut, creating a more sustainable approach to gut health.<br><br>By including prebiotic foods in your recipes, you're providing your body with a natural, food-based way to support your digestive system and overall health, making it an important consideration for a balanced and nutritious diet. Prebiotics are found in various fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Some common prebiotic-rich foods include: <strong>Garlic</strong> : Contains inulin and fructooligosaccharides (FOS), which promote the growth of beneficial bacteria.<br><strong>Onions</strong> : Rich in inulin and FOS, supporting gut health and providing antioxidants.<br><strong>Bananas</strong> : Especially unripe bananas contain resistant starch, a type of prebiotic fiber.<br><strong>Asparagus</strong> : Contains inulin, which supports gut bacteria.<br><strong>Jerusalem Artichokes</strong> : High in inulin, making them excellent for gut health.<br><strong>Oats</strong> : Contain beta-glucan, which acts as a prebiotic.<br><strong>Berries</strong> : Provide fiber and polyphenols that support gut health</p>

<p><strong>Prep time</strong> : 20 minutes<strong>Cook time:</strong> 0<strong>Total time</strong> : 2:30 (2:10 hours of freeze time)<strong>Course</strong> : dessert<strong>Diet</strong> : Paleo, Gluten-free, Grain-free, Refined Sugar-Free, and Dairy-Free<strong>Servings</strong> : 5 ice cream bars<br><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>13.5 oz organic coconut cream</li>
<li>1/4 cup of organic creamy almond butter</li>
<li>1/4 cup + 1 tbsp of organic maple syrup</li>
<li>2 tsp organic vanilla extract</li>
<li>2–3 capsules of Just Thrive Probiotic</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chocolate Coating:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup organic vegan dark chocolate</li>
<li>1 tsp coconut oil</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Topping:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Crushed almonds</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare the ice cream: In a high-speed blender, combine the coconut cream, almond butter, syrup, vanilla extract, and the contents of 2–3 capsules of Just Thrive Probiotic. Blend until smooth and creamy.</li>
<li>Pour into molds: Pour the ice cream into popsicle molds, filling them evenly. Tap the molds gently on the countertop to remove any air bubbles.</li>
<li>Place the filled molds in the freezer for at least 2 hours or until the ice cream bars are completely frozen.</li>
<li>Prepare the Coating: Melt the dark chocolate and coconut oil over low heat in a double boiler until smooth and well combined.</li>
<li>Coat the bars: Remove the frozen ice cream bars from the molds. If they're stuck, run them under warm water for a few seconds to loosen. Place them on a sheet of parchment paper. Dip each bar into the melted chocolate, ensuring they're evenly coated. Immediately sprinkle crushed almonds on top before the chocolate sets.</li>
<li>Return the chocolate-coated bars to the freezer for 10–12 minutes to allow the chocolate to set fully.</li>
<li>Once the chocolate is set, your chocolate ice cream bars are ready to be enjoyed! Store any leftovers in the freezer for future cravings.</li>

<li>1–2 tablespoons lemon zest about 1 large lemon</li>
<li>2–3 capsules of Just Thrive Probiotic</li>

<li>2 ¾ cup gluten-free baking flour</li>
<li>1 cup blanched almond flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, beat together all wet ingredients until well incorporated.</li>
<li>Add in the dry ingredients.</li>
<li>Use a whisk to mix together until well combined, but careful not to over-mix. It shouldn't be runny, but definitely won't be thick either.</li>
<li>Pour into your prepared pan(s) and add to the oven. Depending on the pan size, it may take a bit longer. For example, a 6 inch pan might take 45 minutes.</li>
<li>Check with a toothpick to test if it’s finished. The top should be golden brown, and there should be no jiggling on the inside.</li>
<li>Remove from the oven, let cool for about 10 minutes, then carefully flip onto a cooling rack and peel off the parchment paper. If you're making a sheet cake, you are welcome to leave it right in there and frost it in the pan for easy storage.</li>
<li>Let cool completely before frosting. I suggest sticking in the fridge for about an hour to ensure it's fully cool.</li>
<li>I used Miss Jones Baking Co. for an easy and fun frosting, then sprinkled Supernatural Rainbow sprinkles on top. You can always whip up your own too!</li>
<li>Frost the cake once cool and enjoy!</li>

<p><strong>Prep time</strong> : 15 minutes<strong>Cook time</strong> : 35 minutes<strong>Total time</strong> : 50 minutes<strong>Course</strong> : Dessert<strong>Diet</strong> : Paleo, Gluten-free, Grain-free, Refined Sugar-Free, and Dairy-Free<strong>Servings</strong> : 6 large muffins<br><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>2 pasture-raised eggs</li>
<li>2 ripe organic bananas (the spottier, the better!)</li>
<li>4 tablespoons of organic virgin coconut oil</li>
<li>2 teaspoons of organic vanilla</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of organic cashew milk (or any milk you prefer)</li>
<li>1 large organic carrot, grated (let's sneak in some veggies!)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of baking soda (for that perfect rise)</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon real salt</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of organic Ceylon cinnamon</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of organic golden milk tea spice (trust us, it's a game-changer)</li>
<li>1/2 cup of organic coconut sugar</li>
<li>2 cups of almond flour</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of coconut flour</li>
<li>2–3 Just Thrive Probiotic capsules</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directions:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to 350°F. Grab your favorite large silicone muffin pan and coat it with oil.</li>
<li>In your mixing bowl, start by whisking eggs. Then, add in the bananas and give them a little mash. Add coconut oil, vanilla extract, and cashew milk. With your hand mixer in hand, blend everything until you've got a velvety, creamy mixture.</li>
<li>Toss in that grated carrot and stir it all up until it's evenly distributed throughout the batter. We're sneaking in some veggies because why not?</li>
<li>Next, add all the dry ingredients. Mix everything until you have a thick, luscious batter.</li>
<li>Spoon that glorious batter into your prepared silicone muffin pan, filling each cup about two-thirds of the way full.</li>
<li>Pop those into the oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
<li>Resist the urge to dive in immediately (we know it's tough!). Let the muffins cool for 25 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
<li>Enjoy your gut-loving carrot cake muffins. Grab one (or two, we won't judge), pour yourself a cup of tea or coffee, and enjoy every delicious, gut-loving bite!</li>

<p><strong>Prep time:</strong> 20 minutes<strong>Cook time:</strong> 40 minutes<strong>Total time:</strong> 1 hour<strong>Diet:</strong> Gluten free, dairy free, vegan<strong>Servings:</strong> 4<br><strong>Ingredients:</strong> <i>For the roasted butternut squash:</i></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>1 medium butternut squash, skin on, sliced ¼ inch thick</li>
<li>2 tablespoons avocado oil</li>
<li>Sea salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>For the smashed avocado:</li>
<li>2 avocados</li>
<li>Sea salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
<p><i>For the probiotic cashew drizzle:</i></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup cashews, soaked overnight and strained</li>
<li>The juice of 1 lemon</li>
<li>½ cup of filtered water</li>
<li>2 capsules of <a title="probiotic" href="https://justthrivehealth.com/products/probiotic" target="_blank">Just Thrive Probiotic</a>, just the powder</li>
<li>1 tsp coconut aminos</li>
<li>½ tsp Celtic sea salt</li>
<li>A pinch of black pepper</li>
</ul>
<p><i>For the assembly:</i></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>4 slices of gluten free bread, toasted</li>
<li>Coconut oil or grass fed butter (to spread on the toast)</li>
<li>2 large radishes, thinly sliced</li>
<li>Pickled onions (you can make your own* or buy them)</li>
</ul>
<p>*If you’d like to make your own, I use celebrity health coach Kelly Leveque’s recipe: whisk together 1 cup filtered water, ½ cup of apple cider vinegar, 1 tbsp coconut sugar and 1 tsp sea salt. Thinly slice 1 red onion and place it in a mason jar. Pour the liquid over the onions. Cover the mason jar and leave the jar out at room temperature for about an hour. Transfer the jar to the fridge and enjoy them as you see fit. They last for months in the fridge.<br><strong>Instructions:</strong> Preheat oven to 400F.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>Begin by roasting your butternut squash. You can prepare this ahead of time and just keep it in your fridge for when you want to whip it out to make more toast!</li>
<li>Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Place your thinly sliced pieces on the pans and drizzle them with avocado oil, sea salt and pepper. Toss with your hands to ensure all the pieces are coated with oil and then spread them back out evenly across the pan.</li>
<li>Bake for 20 - 40 minutes, or until tender. Remove from the oven and set aside.</li>
<li>Next, make your cashew drizzle. Place cashews, lemon juice, water, coconut aminos, probiotic powder, sea salt and pepper in a blender and blend on high until smooth and creamy. If the consistency is too thick, add a teaspoon of water and blend again. Continue adding water until you get the consistency you desire (like a thick dressing). You may have to adjust your seasonings if you end up adding a lot of water. Place in a mason jar and set aside.</li>
<li>Toast your bread as desired. Smear it with either coconut oil or grass fed butter. Then smash avocado onto all 4 pieces of toast with a fork. Top with sea salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Next, cut your roasted butternut squash into pieces that fit the toast and place on top of the avocado. Then top the squash with neatly arranged sliced radishes, followed by about a tablespoon of pickled onions per piece of toast.</li>
<li>Drizzle some of the pickled onion juice over the pieces of toast.</li>
<li>Finally, drizzle the toast with about a tablespoon of probiotic cashew drizzle to finish off your toast. If you’d like to get fancy, consider adding a few microgreens to the top of each slice of toast for added color and nutrition.</li>
<li>Slice to the desired sizes, serve and enjoy!</li>
