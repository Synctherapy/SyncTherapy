<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How Photobiomodulation (PBM) Works at a Cellular Level</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The scientific term for how RLT works is photobiomodulation (PBM). The process begins when the photons from the red and infrared light are absorbed by photoreceptors within the cells, primarily a component in the mitochondria called Cytochrome c oxidase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The mitochondria are the "powerhouses" of the cell, responsible for producing Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), which is the energy currency for all cellular functions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By stimulating the mitochondria, PBM triggers a cascade of beneficial effects:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Increased ATP Production:</strong> More energy allows cells to function more efficiently, repair damage faster, and replicate healthier cells.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Enhanced Circulation:</strong> PBM promotes the formation of new capillaries, improving blood flow. This increased circulation delivers more oxygen and nutrients to tissues while more effectively removing waste products.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Reduced Oxidative Stress:</strong> The therapy helps decrease oxidative stress, which is a key contributor to inflammation and cellular aging.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Modulated Inflammation:</strong> It helps regulate the body’s inflammatory response, reducing chronic inflammation without hindering the acute inflammation necessary for healing.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Differentiating RLT from Other Light Therapies (e.g., Laser Therapy, Infrared Heat)</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's important to distinguish RLT from other light-based treatments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul class="wp-block-list"><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Laser Therapy:</strong> While lasers also use light, they deliver a concentrated, coherent beam of light to a very small area. This is often used for precise, deep-tissue work under professional supervision. RLT, typically using LEDs, covers a much broader area with less intensity, making it safer and more practical for regular use by horse owners.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li><strong>Infrared Heat Lamps:</strong> These devices primarily produce heat. While the warmth can be soothing and temporarily increase circulation, they do not deliver the specific, non-thermal wavelengths required to trigger photobiomodulation at a cellular level. RLT’s benefits come from light energy, not heat.</li>
