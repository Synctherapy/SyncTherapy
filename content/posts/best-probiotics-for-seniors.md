The gut microbiome tends to decline in diversity as we get older, making seniors more susceptible to gastrointestinal issues like constipation and infections. Probiotics can help counteract this decline by replenishing healthy bacteria in the gut. However, with so many probiotic supplements available today, how do you know which one is right for seniors?<span style="color: var(--awb-text-color); font-family: var(--awb-text-font-family); font-size: var(--awb-font-size); font-style: var(--awb-text-font-style); font-weight: var(--awb-text-font-weight); letter-spacing: var(--awb-letter-spacing); text-align: var(--awb-content-alignment); text-transform: var(--awb-text-transform); background-color: var(--awb-bg-color-hover);"><br></span></p> <p>By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of which <a href="https://synctherapylocal.local/probiotics-for-women/"  data-wpil-monitor-id="5">probiotics are best suited to boosting gut health in the over 50</a> crowd.
