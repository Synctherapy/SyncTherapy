<p><strong>Trigger point therapy is often more effective for Victoria athletes dealing with specific pain areas, while deep tissue massage works better for overall muscle tension and recovery.</strong></p>
<p>Trigger point therapy targets <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000399931930108X">myofascial trigger points</a> - those tight knots in muscles that can cause pain even in other body parts. This targeted approach can help athletes with recurring pain in specific spots.</p>
<p>Deep tissue massage, meanwhile, focuses on broader muscle groups and connective tissues. It helps increase blood flow throughout the body and can address <a href="https://journals.lww.com/cjsportsmed/fulltext/2018/09000/Nonpharmacological_Management_of_Persistent_Pain.8.aspx">persistent pain according to a biopsychosocial model</a>, which many sports medicine professionals recommend.</p>
<p>The best choice depends on an athlete's specific needs and the type of sport they practice.</p>
<h2>Understanding Deep Tissue Therapy</h2>
<p><iframe style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9; width: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UIKDx0FcAgU" title="UIKDx0FcAgU"></iframe></p>
<p>Deep tissue therapy targets the deeper layers of muscles and connective tissue, using significant pressure to release chronic tension patterns. This therapeutic approach provides lasting relief through specific techniques that focus on the body's deeper structures.</p>
<h3>Principles of Deep Tissue Work</h3>
<p>Deep tissue work differs from regular massage by focusing on deeper muscle layers and fascia (connective tissue). Therapists apply firm pressure and slow strokes to reach these deep structures.</p>
<p>The primary goal is to break down adhesions—bands of painful, rigid tissue that can disrupt circulation and cause inflammation.</p>
<p>The pressure used in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000399931930108X">deep tissue therapy</a> is deliberately firmer than standard massage. Therapists work layer by layer, first warming superficial tissues before addressing deeper structures.</p>
<p>This methodical approach allows for effective treatment without causing excessive discomfort.</p>
<p>Therapists often use their forearms, elbows, knuckles, and thumbs to apply the necessary pressure. Deep tissue work requires focused attention on problem areas rather than general full-body treatment.</p>
<h3>Benefits for Muscle Tension and Chronic Pain</h3>
<p>Athletes experiencing muscle tension and chronic pain can find significant relief through deep tissue therapy. This approach effectively addresses issues common in sports performance.</p>
<p>Key benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Reduced muscle tension</strong> in chronically tight areas</li>
<li>
<strong>Improved range of motion</strong> in joints</li>
<li>
<strong>Decreased pain</strong> from old injuries</li>
<li>
<strong>Enhanced recovery</strong> between training sessions</li>
<li>
<strong>Better blood circulation</strong> to damaged tissues</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://journals.lww.com/cjsportsmed/fulltext/2018/09000/Nonpharmacological_Management_of_Persistent_Pain.8.aspx">Research indicates</a> that deep tissue work helps manage persistent pain in elite athletes by altering the loads on soft tissue. For Victoria athletes dealing with repetitive strain injuries or overuse symptoms, this therapy provides targeted relief at the source of discomfort.</p>
<p>The therapy also helps break the cycle of tension-pain-tension that many athletes experience during intense training periods.</p>
<h3>Deep Tissue Techniques and Practices</h3>
<p>Several specific techniques characterize effective deep tissue therapy sessions for athletes. These approaches are systematically applied to achieve maximum benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-fiber friction</strong> involves applying pressure perpendicular to the muscle fibers to break down scar tissue and adhesions. This technique is particularly valuable for treating tendonitis and muscle strains common in competitive sports.</p>
<p><strong>Stripping</strong> techniques involve deep, gliding pressure along the length of muscle fibers. Therapists use thumbs, knuckles, or elbows to apply sustained pressure while slowly moving along the muscle.</p>
<p><strong>Compression</strong> involves applying direct pressure to specific points to release tension. This method is often held for 30-60 seconds until the therapist feels the tissue release.</p>
<p>Deep tissue sessions typically last 60-90 minutes. Athletes may experience some discomfort during treatment—often described as "good pain"—but should communicate with their therapist to ensure pressure remains therapeutic rather than harmful.</p>
<h2>Exploring Trigger Point Therapy</h2>
<p><iframe style="aspect-ratio: 16 / 9; width: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I1bBdcRHnkI" title="I1bBdcRHnkI"></iframe></p>
<p>Trigger point therapy offers targeted relief for athletes dealing with persistent pain and restricted movement. This technique identifies and releases specific points of tension that can affect performance and recovery.</p>
<h3>Identifying Trigger Points</h3>
<p>Trigger points are small, hyper-irritable spots found in taut bands of muscle tissue. These knots often form due to repetitive motions, poor posture, or overtraining common in athletic activities. When pressed, they can cause pain both locally and in seemingly unrelated areas (referred pain).</p>
<p>Athletes can identify potential trigger points through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Areas of consistent pain or tenderness</li>
<li>Muscles that feel tight or restricted</li>
<li>Spots that produce pain when pressed</li>
<li>Regions that limit range of motion</li>
</ul>
<p>Trained therapists can locate these points through palpation, feeling for taut bands and nodules within the muscle tissue. Some <a href="https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article-abstract/21/2/e172/5566637">athletes use infrared thermography</a> to identify problematic areas, as trigger points often show increased temperature during activity.</p>
<h3>Impact on Mobility and Recovery</h3>
<p>Trigger points significantly affect athletic performance by limiting range of motion and causing pain during movement. When left untreated, these issues can develop into chronic conditions that hinder training progress.</p>
<p>The effects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Restricted movement</strong> in joints associated with affected muscles</li>
<li>
<strong>Altered biomechanics</strong> leading to compensatory movement patterns</li>
<li>
<strong>Delayed recovery</strong> between training sessions</li>
<li>
<strong>Decreased power output</strong> in affected muscle groups</li>
</ul>
<p>For Victoria athletes, addressing trigger points promptly can prevent these issues from escalating. Triathletes with calf trigger points often experience <a href="https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article-abstract/21/2/e172/5566637">limited ankle dorsiflexion</a>, while cricket bowlers may see <a href="https://openscholar.dut.ac.za/handle/10321/445">reduced bowling speed</a> due to shoulder trigger points.</p>
<h3>Trigger Point Therapy Procedures</h3>
<p>Treatment approaches for trigger points vary based on severity and location. The primary goal is to release the contracted muscle fibers and restore normal blood flow to the area.</p>
<p>Common trigger point therapy techniques include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Manual pressure</strong> - Applying sustained pressure to the trigger point until release</li>
<li>
<strong>Dry needling</strong> - Inserting thin needles into trigger points to disrupt contracted fibers</li>
<li>
<strong>Trigger point acupuncture</strong> - Targeting <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1155/2022/9467002">myofascial trigger points</a> with acupuncture techniques</li>
<li>
<strong>Shockwave therapy</strong> - Using <a href="https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA349609704&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;linkaccess=abs&amp;issn=1059096X&amp;p=HRCA&amp;sw=w">acoustic pressure waves</a> to break up nodules</li>
</ol>
<p>For optimal results, many therapists combine these techniques with stretching and corrective exercises. Treatment sessions typically last 30-60 minutes, with athletes often reporting immediate improvements in mobility and decreased pain levels.</p>
<h2>Conventional Treatments for Sports Injuries</h2>
<p><img src="https://synctherapylocal.local/wp-content/uploads/content/v2-s88ch-3gzfp.jpg" alt="A sports therapist administers deep tissue and trigger point therapy on an injured athlete's leg muscles in a clinic setting"></p>
<p>Athletes in Victoria regularly face injuries that require proper treatment for optimal recovery and performance. Traditional approaches focus on hands-on techniques, structured exercise programs, and customized care plans that address individual needs.</p>
<h3>Role of Manual Therapy</h3>
<p>Manual therapy serves as a cornerstone for treating <a data-wpil="url" href="https://synctherapylocal.local/conditions/">sports injuries</a> among athletes.

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000399931930108X">Trigger point therapy</a> specifically targets myofascial pain that can limit performance. This technique involves applying pressure to tight muscle areas to release tension and restore function.</p>
<p>Deep tissue massage works by addressing deeper muscle layers and connective tissues that may be damaged during athletic activities. The pressure applied helps break down scar tissue and improve blood flow to injured areas.</p>
<p>Physical therapists and sports medicine professionals often combine different manual therapy approaches based on the specific injury type and severity. Research shows these hands-on methods can significantly reduce recovery time for many common sports injuries.</p>
<h3>Incorporating Therapeutic Exercise</h3>
<p>Therapeutic exercise forms an essential component of rehabilitation for injured athletes. Properly designed exercise programs help restore strength, flexibility, and functional movement patterns.</p>
<p>Programs typically progress through several phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Acute phase</strong>: Gentle movements to maintain mobility without aggravating the injury</li>
<li>
<strong>Recovery phase</strong>: Progressive resistance training and sport-specific movements</li>
<li>
<strong>Return-to-sport phase</strong>: Performance-oriented exercises that mimic competitive demands</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://scholar.archive.org/work/4gmh4rchvvdqnhywdfrfmnzdxq/access/wayback/https://openscholar.dut.ac.za/bitstream/10321/2574/1/SCHMIDT-KINSMAN_S_2017.pdf">Muscle strength development</a> is crucial for athletes, as it directly impacts performance and helps prevent future injuries. Exercises often target both the injured area and supporting muscle groups.</p>
<p>Structured programs should include balance, proprioception, and neuromuscular control exercises alongside traditional strength work. This comprehensive approach helps address underlying movement problems that may have contributed to the initial injury.</p>
<h3>Importance of Personalized Treatment Plans</h3>
<p>No two athletes respond identically to treatment approaches, making personalized care essential. Factors like injury history, sport demands, and recovery goals must shape individual treatment plans.</p>
<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00256-022-04175-6">Proper stratification of patients</a> allows practitioners to customize treatment decisions based on specific needs. This might include varying the intensity of manual therapy or modifying exercise progressions.</p>
<p>Assessment tools help clinicians track progress and make necessary adjustments. These may include:</p>

<p>Both deep tissue and trigger point therapy offer distinct benefits for athletes seeking to enhance their physical condition and recovery. Research indicates that proper application of these techniques can significantly impact performance metrics and injury prevention.</p>
<h3>Improving Performance and Flexibility</h3>
<p>Deep tissue massage targets the deeper layers of muscle and connective tissue, making it highly effective for improving range of motion in athletes. This technique helps break down adhesions and scar tissue that limit mobility, allowing for more efficient movement patterns during training and competition.</p>
<p>Trigger point therapy, on the other hand, focuses on specific tension areas. Studies suggest that it may be more effective than other myofascial techniques for certain conditions, as seen in research comparing treatments for <a href="https://uobrep.openrepository.com/handle/10547/322490">non-specific neck pain</a>. This targeted approach can help release chronically tight muscles that restrict athletic performance.</p>
<p>Athletes often experience improved blood circulation after both treatments. This enhanced blood flow delivers more oxygen and nutrients to muscles, potentially improving endurance and recovery time.</p>

<h3>Preventing and Managing Pain Relief</h3>
<p>Pain management is crucial for athletes' long-term wellbeing.</p>
<p>Deep tissue massage provides broad relief across muscle groups, addressing widespread tension that can lead to compensatory injuries.</p>
<p>For acute pain points, trigger point therapy shows promising results.</p>
<p>In competitive swimmers, <a href="https://scholar.archive.org/work/4gmh4rchvvdqnhywdfrfmnzdxq/access/wayback/https://openscholar.dut.ac.za/bitstream/10321/2574/1/SCHMIDT-KINSMAN_S_2017.pdf">trigger point dry needling of shoulder muscles</a> has been studied for its effects on performance and pain reduction.</p>
<p>This targeted approach can precisely address pain generators that compromise athletic function.</p>
<p>Regular maintenance treatments can prevent minor issues from developing into serious injuries.</p>
<p>Many health practitioners working with athletes implement both modalities depending on the specific needs and injury history of the individual.</p>
<p>Pain prevention strategies differ by sport type.</p>
<p>Team sports like basketball and soccer may benefit from different approaches than individual sports, as athletic demands vary significantly according to <a href="https://meridian.allenpress.com/jcep/article/13/s2/445/500304">research on recovery strategies</a>.</p>
<h2>Complementary Therapies and Holistic Approaches</h2>
<p><img src="https://synctherapylocal.local/wp-content/uploads/content/v2-s88dk-n9cfh.jpg" alt="A serene massage studio with soft lighting and soothing music, featuring a massage table and various essential oils and lotions neatly arranged on a shelf"></p>
<p>Athletes in Victoria seeking optimal performance and recovery can benefit from integrating multiple therapeutic approaches alongside deep tissue and trigger point therapies.</p>
<p>These complementary methods enhance treatment outcomes and address the whole person rather than just the injury site.</p>
<h3>Integration with Physiotherapy and Osteopathy</h3>

<p>For instance, <a href="https://uobrep.openrepository.com/handle/10547/322490">trigger point therapy may be suggested</a> between physiotherapy sessions to maintain tissue pliability and reduce pain.</p>
<p>Osteopathic practitioners, with their focus on the musculoskeletal system, frequently incorporate soft tissue techniques into treatment.</p>
<p>This combination addresses both structural alignment and <a data-wpil="url" href="https://synctherapylocal.local/conditions/back-pain-victoria/">muscle tension</a> issues that athletes commonly face.</p>
<p>Research shows that athletes receiving both osteopathic manipulation and targeted massage therapy report better functional outcomes than those receiving single-modality treatment.</p>
<p>This synergistic effect makes the combination particularly valuable for competitive swimmers and other high-performance athletes.</p>
<h3>Benefiting from Alternatives like Acupuncture</h3>
<p>Acupuncture offers Victoria athletes another valuable therapeutic option that complements massage-based treatments.</p>
<p>This ancient practice targets specific points that often correlate with trigger points addressed in massage therapy.</p>
<p><a href="https://scholar.archive.org/work/4gmh4rchvvdqnhywdfrfmnzdxq/access/wayback/https://openscholar.dut.ac.za/bitstream/10321/2574/1/SCHMIDT-KINSMAN_S_2017.pdf">Dry needling techniques</a> have shown promising results for improving athletic performance. Studies with competitive swimmers demonstrated improved lap times following treatment of shoulder girdle muscles.</p>
<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine approaches consider the body's energy systems when treating athletic issues.</p>
<p>This holistic perspective can identify underlying imbalances that might contribute to recurring injuries.</p>
<p>Many sports medicine clinics in Victoria now offer integrated services where athletes can receive both massage therapy and acupuncture during the same treatment session for enhanced outcomes.</p>
<h3>Synergy with Wellness Practices</h3>
<p>Nutrition plays a crucial role in supporting tissue health and recovery.</p>
<p>Athletes require specific nutritional approaches that complement their therapeutic treatments, especially <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=ISZY-PQv_ggC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=Complementary+Therapies+and+Holistic+Approaches+Deep+Tissue+vs+Trigger+Point+Therapy:+What%E2%80%99s+Best+for+Victoria+Athletes%3F+&amp;ots=sHf8Ygpqer&amp;sig=qrQgc7xC2yYFqa-VCcAZ-AyXJ4o">vegetarian athletes who may have unique needs</a>.</p>
<p>Mindfulness and stress-reduction techniques enhance the effectiveness of physical therapies.</p>
<p>Athletes who practice meditation report greater benefits from massage therapy sessions, likely due to reduced muscle tension.</p>
<p>Sleep quality significantly impacts tissue healing and recovery.</p>
<p>Massage therapists often advise athletes on sleep positioning to complement their treatments and prevent nighttime muscle tension.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amt.org.au/downloads/journal-archive/June2016.pdf">Strategic stretching protocols</a> work synergistically with both deep tissue and trigger point therapies.</p>
<p>Proper timing of stretches—before or after intense activity—maximizes the benefits of massage treatments for Victoria athletes.</p>
<h2>Considerations for Treatment Selection</h2>
<p><img src="https://synctherapylocal.local/wp-content/uploads/content/v2-s88e7-r5pm5.jpg" alt="A muscular athlete receiving deep tissue massage on a massage table, while the therapist focuses on specific trigger points in the muscles"></p>
<p>Choosing between deep tissue and trigger point therapy requires careful assessment of the athlete's specific condition, training schedule, and recovery needs. The right therapy can significantly impact performance outcomes and injury prevention.</p>
<h3>Addressing Health Concerns and Muscle Spasms</h3>
<p>Athletes in Victoria often experience muscle spasms that can impair performance and training consistency.</p>
<p>Deep tissue massage works well for widespread tension, applying broad pressure to release entire muscle groups.

<p>Treatment timing is crucial - therapy during active training phases differs from <a data-wpil="url" href="https://synctherapylocal.local/red-light-therapy-for-chronic-fatigue/">recovery periods</a> between competitions.</p>
<h3>Athlete-Centric Focus on Recovery and Health Goals</h3>
<p>Every athlete has unique performance goals that should guide treatment selection.</p>
<p>Sprinters might benefit from trigger point therapy to address specific power-limiting muscle knots, while endurance athletes often need the broader tension relief of deep tissue work.</p>
<p>Recovery timeframes must be considered. Deep tissue can sometimes create temporary soreness that might interfere with immediate performance, while trigger point work typically allows quicker return to activity.</p>
<p>Training periodization should align with therapy scheduling:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Pre-competition</strong>: Often lighter, targeted work</li>
<li>
<strong>Heavy training phases</strong>: More intensive deep work</li>
<li>
<strong>Recovery periods</strong>: Maintenance approaches</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/47/9/536.short">Elite athletes require customized approaches</a> that consider their unique physiological demands. Both therapies can be integrated in a comprehensive treatment plan, with proportions adjusted based on assessment findings.</p>
<p>The athlete's feedback during and after sessions provides vital information for future treatment refinement, ensuring optimal results aligned with health and performance goals.</p>
<h2>Professional Insights and Recommendations</h2>
<p><img src="https://synctherapylocal.local/wp-content/uploads/content/v2-s88ew-8apf8.jpg" alt="A deep tissue vs trigger point therapy scene in a sports setting with equipment and tools"></p>
<p>Athletes benefit from expert guidance when choosing between deep tissue and trigger point therapies. Trained professionals can provide personalized approaches tailored to specific sports injuries and performance goals.</p>
<h3>Role of Registered Massage Therapist</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://journals.lww.com/cjsportsmed/fulltext/2018/09000/Nonpharmacological_Management_of_Persistent_Pain.8.aspx">registered massage therapist</a> brings specialized knowledge to the treatment of athletic injuries. These professionals understand the unique demands placed on athletes' bodies and can identify specific issues that require targeted therapy.</p>
<p>RMTs are trained to distinguish between muscle tension patterns that respond better to deep tissue techniques versus those requiring trigger point therapy. This expertise is crucial for proper treatment selection.</p>
<p>Many therapists combine both approaches, using deep tissue work to address general muscle tightness while employing trigger point techniques for specific problem areas. Their training allows them to detect subtle tissue changes that might escape untrained observation.</p>
<p>Professional credentials matter when selecting a therapist. Athletes should verify proper licensing and sports-specific training before beginning treatment sessions.</p>
<h3>Developing Effective Treatment Plans</h3>
<p>A comprehensive treatment plan considers both immediate pain relief and long-term performance enhancement.</p>
<p>Therapists typically begin with a thorough assessment of the athlete's condition, movement patterns, and sport-specific demands.</p>
<p>Frequency of sessions varies based on injury severity and competition schedules. Acute injuries may require 2-3 sessions weekly, while maintenance might involve bi-weekly appointments.</p>
<p>Treatment plans should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Initial assessment</strong> phase</li>
<li>
<strong>Therapeutic intervention</strong> stage</li>
<li>
<strong>Functional integration</strong> period</li>
<li>
<strong>Maintenance</strong> protocol</li>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><img src="https://synctherapylocal.local/wp-content/uploads/content/v2-s88fi-vyc78.jpg" alt="A deep tissue massage therapist working on a tense muscle while a trigger point therapist focuses on a specific point nearby. A group of athletes watches attentively"></p>
<p>Athletes in Victoria often wonder about the best massage therapy options for their specific needs. These questions address key differences between deep tissue and trigger point therapy, their effectiveness for various conditions, and practical considerations for integrating these treatments into training schedules.</p>
<h3>What are the main differences between deep tissue and trigger point therapies?</h3>
<p>Deep tissue massage targets broader muscle groups and connective tissues using sustained pressure to release chronic tension patterns. It works on multiple layers of muscle and fascia simultaneously.</p>
<p>Trigger point therapy focuses on specific, isolated knots or <a href="https://scholar.archive.org/work/4gmh4rchvvdqnhywdfrfmnzdxq/access/wayback/https://openscholar.dut.ac.za/bitstream/10321/2574/1/SCHMIDT-KINSMAN_S_2017.pdf">myofascial trigger points</a> that can refer pain to other areas. Practitioners apply direct pressure to these specific points rather than working entire muscle groups.</p>
<p>The sensations also differ - deep tissue typically creates a sustained pressure sensation across larger areas, while trigger point work produces a more intense, focused sensation.</p>
<h3>How does trigger point therapy compare to deep tissue for sports-related injuries?</h3>
<p>Trigger point therapy excels at addressing acute pain from specific overused muscles common in repetitive motion injuries. It can provide immediate relief for tennis elbow, runner's knee, and swimmer's shoulder.</p>

<p>Swimmers, for example, have shown improved performance after <a href="https://scholar.archive.org/work/4gmh4rchvvdqnhywdfrfmnzdxq/access/wayback/https://openscholar.dut.ac.za/bitstream/10321/2574/1/SCHMIDT-KINSMAN_S_2017.pdf">trigger point dry needling of shoulder muscles</a>.</p>
<p>Deep tissue massage typically produces better long-term flexibility improvements, which benefits athletes in sports requiring extensive range of motion like gymnastics or martial arts.</p>
<p>Regular trigger point therapy helps maintain muscle activation patterns and prevent compensatory movements that reduce efficiency, particularly valuable for endurance athletes.</p>
<h3>Are there any specific benefits of deep tissue massage for athletes recovering from muscle strain?</h3>
<p>Deep tissue massage improves circulation to injured areas, accelerating the delivery of nutrients and removal of metabolic waste products from healing tissues. This can reduce recovery time from strains.</p>
<p>It effectively breaks down scar tissue that forms during the healing process, maintaining proper muscle fiber alignment and preventing long-term stiffness or weakness after injury.</p>
<p>Deep tissue work also <a href="https://journals.lww.com/cjsportsmed/fulltext/2018/09000/Nonpharmacological_Management_of_Persistent_Pain.8.aspx">addresses the loads on soft tissues</a> surrounding the strained area, preventing compensatory patterns that might lead to secondary injuries.</p>
<h3>What are the potential drawbacks of choosing deep tissue therapy over sports massage?</h3>
<p>Deep tissue massage often causes more post-treatment soreness than sports massage, which may interfere with training schedules if not properly timed. Athletes might need 24-48 hours before returning to intense training.</p>
<p>It provides less emphasis on sport-specific movement patterns compared to sports massage, which often incorporates movement assessment and functional techniques.</p>
<p>Deep tissue work focuses primarily on tissue quality rather than neuromuscular retraining, which some athletes may need for optimal performance.</p>
<h3>How soon after a deep tissue or trigger point massage can an athlete typically return to training?</h3>
<p>Most athletes can resume light training 6-12 hours after trigger point therapy. The targeted nature of the treatment typically causes minimal systemic fatigue.</p>
<p>Deep tissue massage often requires 24-48 hours before returning to intense training due to the more comprehensive nature of the work and temporary inflammation response.</p>
<p>Hydration status significantly affects recovery time. Well-hydrated athletes typically recover more quickly from both therapies and can return to training sooner.</p>
