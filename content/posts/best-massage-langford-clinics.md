<p>If you're tossing and turning at night, you're not alone. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://juniperrmt.com/massage/massage-therapy-for-better-sleep/">Approximately 33% of adults experience chronic insomnia symptoms</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://juniperrmt.com/massage/massage-therapy-for-better-sleep/"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, making quality sleep a serious health concern. Massage therapy in Langford offers a scientifically-backed solution for both better sleep and faster recovery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Research confirms massage therapy significantly improves sleep efficiency and duration <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/13/2/180"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. After just one 45-minute relaxation massage, studies show sleep efficiency improves by about 10.8% <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://juniperrmt.com/massage/massage-therapy-for-better-sleep/"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, helping you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How does massage therapy work? First, it reduces cortisol (your stress hormone) while increasing serotonin and dopamine levels <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.naturalbody.com/blog/how-to-use-massage-to-improve-sleep"><sup>[3]</sup></a>. These neurotransmitters help produce melatonin—the hormone that regulates your sleep cycle <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sleepopolis.com/education/massage-for-sleep/"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. Furthermore, massage activates your parasympathetic nervous system—your body's "rest and digest" mode <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.naturalbody.com/blog/how-to-use-massage-to-improve-sleep"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For recovery, massage therapy addresses pain that often disrupts sleep. Deep tissue massage at an RMT Langford clinic can break down adhesions and scar tissue <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12140169/"><sup>[5]</sup></a>, while techniques like Swedish massage are particularly effective for promoting relaxation <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sleepopolis.com/education/massage-for-sleep/"><sup>[4]</sup></a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beyond immediate benefits, regular massage sessions at Westshore massage therapy clinics create lasting improvements in sleep patterns. This is particularly valuable for those with fibromyalgia <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amtamassage.org/about/position-statements/massage-therapy-can-help-improve-sleep/"><sup>[6]</sup></a>, post-surgical recovery <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amtamassage.org/about/position-statements/massage-therapy-can-help-improve-sleep/"><sup>[6]</sup></a>, and menopausal women experiencing sleep disturbances <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4521661/"><sup>[7]</sup></a>.</p>
