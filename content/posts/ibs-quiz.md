                <p>Though they sound similar and share symptoms like pain and unpredictable bowel movements, IBS and IBD are fundamentally different. Understanding these differences is key to getting the right help. The main distinction lies in the physical impact on your gut and the underlying cause, which is often related to the gut-brain axis. This quiz can also help you start to differentiate if your symptoms lean more towards functional issues like IBS or might require investigation for conditions like IBD, endometriosis, or lactose intolerance.</p>

                <p>If you have IBS-like symptoms, especially bloating, it's worth knowing about SIBO. Research shows a significant overlap: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5347643/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary font-semibold hover:underline">up to 78% of people diagnosed with IBS may also have SIBO</a> (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth).</p>

                <h3 class="font-bold text-primary"><i class="fas fa-bacteria mr-2"></i>What is the link? It often starts with food poisoning.</h3>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mt-4">
                    <li><strong>The Trigger:</strong> You get a bout of gastroenteritis (food poisoning).</li>
                    <li><strong>The Damage:</strong> Toxins from the bad bacteria can damage the nerves responsible for your gut's "cleansing waves," which normally sweep food and bacteria down into the colon.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Overgrowth:</strong> With the cleansing waves impaired, bacteria from your large intestine can migrate up and multiply in your small intestine, where they don't belong. This is SIBO.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Symptoms:</strong> These misplaced bacteria ferment the food you eat, producing excess gas (hydrogen, methane). This gas is a primary driver of the <a href="https://synctherapylocal.local/do-probiotics-help-with-bloating/" class="text-primary font-semibold hover:underline">managing IBS bloating</a>, pain, constipation (IBS-C), and/or diarrhea (IBS-D) that define many IBS triggers.</li>

                    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg"><i class="fas fa-lightbulb text-accent mr-2"></i>Finding the Root Cause: The Antibody Test</h4>
                    <p class="mt-2">There's a way to connect the dots. A simple antibody blood test (like <strong>IBS-Smart</strong>) can "rule-in" post-infectious IBS. It looks for two key antibodies (anti-CdtB and anti-vinculin) that act as markers for a past food poisoning event. This is a specific `IBS blood test name` you can discuss with your doctor.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">A positive result provides a strong clue that food poisoning was the root cause of your symptoms, making SIBO a very likely suspect. For more on this, see our guide to the best probiotics for IBS.</p>

            <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-lg shadow-md space-y-6">
                <p>While this quiz is a great starting point, a formal `IBS diagnosis test` from a healthcare provider is the only way to be certain. Here's what you can expect from the process, including options for an `IBS test at home`.</p>
                <h3 class="font-bold text-primary"><i class="fas fa-comments mr-2"></i>Symptom Evaluation</h3>
                <p>Your doctor will ask detailed questions about your symptoms, their frequency, and how they impact your life. They often use a checklist called the <strong>Rome IV criteria</strong>, which looks for recurrent abdominal pain associated with changes in bowel movements.</p>
                
                <h3 class="font-bold text-primary"><i class="fas fa-vial mr-2"></i>Ruling Out Other Conditions</h3>
                <p>Your doctor's main goal is to ensure nothing more serious is causing your symptoms. This may involve blood tests (`IBS lab test`) to check for inflammation or celiac disease. For SIBO, an `IBS breath test` is the common diagnostic tool. As mentioned, a specific blood test like the <strong>IBS-Smart test</strong> can help confirm if food poisoning was the likely trigger.</p>
