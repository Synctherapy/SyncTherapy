  Head and neck injuries may be the most common injuries from a car accident. Whiplash is a traumatic injury that significantly impacts the central nervous system. About 20% of all victims of car accidents experience whiplash. During a car accident, there is often a high intensity jerking motion. The sudden acceleration and then deceleration movement causes the body to whip sharply forward, backward and sideways, and the impact to the body can be devastating.
<p>Headaches are the bane of existence after a car accident for our clients. The can be nonstop and unremitting. We use a gentle but effective approach to reducing your headaches while teaching you what you can do to stop them in their tracks.</p>

Do you have back pain that makes it uncomfortable to move or how to get comfortable in any position? Using massage therapy to reduce back pain after a car accident is effectiveSoft tissue injuries often include sprains, strains, and contusions. The impact of a crash alone can lead to some of the most common soft tissue injuries. They may seem minor to some, but they can cause long-term problems that can impact your everyday life. Most soft tissue injuries that occur in car accidents are acute damages. They occur as a result of sudden trauma to a person’s bodyWhat Can We Help You WithOur specific massage therapist works with you and ICBC to get the care you deserve and helps you recover from a car accident quicklyIf you’ve been involved in a car accident it can be overwhelming – especially if you have never dealt with an accident before or filed a claim with ICBC. ICBC made changes on April 1, 2019, and is scheduled to make a larger change coming May 2021. The changes are going to be client-centric, this means you get the care you deserve. There’s more of an emphasis on your recovery, so you have easier access to massage therapy, active rehab (athletic therapy or kinesiology), physiotherapy, and chiropractic! We can help guide you during this often confusing process. Your massage therapist understands the ICBC process, can answer your questions, and help you recover along the way with a massage. If you’ve been in a car accident and have an ICBC active claim number, you are pre-approved for 12 Massage Therapy sessions. We do suggest that you use the ICBC approved services right away after an accident, it will improve your recovery time, so it’s important to book a massage If after the 12 sessions you need continued care, we work with you and ICBC to ensure you get the care and attention you deserve until you’re at maximal recovery.523+Happy Clients73+5-Star Google Reviews10+A Decade of experience Daryl is an amazing RMT and know the right spots to press.
